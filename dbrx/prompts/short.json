        "\n\nHuman: Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?\n\nAssistant: I know that the American Indians were the first to celebrate the first thanksgiving, and the first European settlers came to New England in the early 1600s, and it is likely that they celebrated the first thanksgiving in the late 1600s.

        "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about wild dogs? Not stray dogs, but wild dogs.\n\nAssistant: I know a lot about wild dogs. Would you like to read about what a wolf is, or about coyotes?
